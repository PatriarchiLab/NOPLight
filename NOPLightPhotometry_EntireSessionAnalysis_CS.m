% Set group/averaging/smoothing parameters

    RefDecayAdjust = 0; % ADJUST to 1 if you want to match exp trials to reference trials based on curve clustering as the method for decay adjustment
    
    CompareGroups = 1; % ADJUST to 1 if you are comparing multiple groups (A vs B, etc), 0 if you are just looking at trials in A
    CombineGroups = 0; % ADJUST to 1 if you want to look at the combination of all groups post decay adjustment
    
    averageall = 1; % ADJUST to 1 if you want to average all trials for all animals, or 0 if you want to average trials within an animal then average those averages
    
    resamplefactor = 300; % ADJUST to factor you want to resample data at
    
    CurveType = 'poly'; % ADJUST to 'exp' or 'poly' depending on if you want to fit exponential or polynomial curves for decay adjustment
    
    ScaleRef = 1; % ADJUST to 1 to detrend bleaching decay by fitting (scaling) the reference to the signal
    scaleref_BLper = 1; % ADJUST to 1 to scale ref to sig using JUST the BL period bleaching. Good for entire session decay with pharmacology, but for transient events set this to 0 to scale using entire trace

    doSmooth = 1; % ADJUST to 1 if want to apply smoothing to the trace
    smooth_win = 30; % ADJUST period of time for smoothing, in seconds


% Set timing parameters

    manualsessionlength = 0; % ADJUST if sessions compared are not the same length
    newsessionlength = 3000;% ADJUST to lowest common session length, in seconds
    
    BLperiod = [3 260]; %ADJUST to period of time where you want to baseline the trace to (in seconds, ie 1 to 260s when injection is at 300s)
    
    starttime = 2; % ADJUST to time (in seconds) that you want to treat as the beginning of the session
    
    %Event window specific stuff below, doesn't need to be adjusted for
    %this entire session script (just keeping it here to make updating
    %either version easier)
    timewindow = 60; %ADJUST +/- window (seconds) around each event that you want to pull out data for (must contain idxBase values in range)
    
    viewtimewindow = 0; % ADJUST if you want to plot a smaller subset of time than the entire time window of data you'll be analyzing
    viewtimewindowVal = 20; % ADJUST +/- window (seconds) that you want to see in the final plot
    
    manualtimestamps = 0; % ADJUST if you want to override the session's timestamps to enter uniform timestamps manually for all sessions
    newtimestamps = [120;240;360;480]; %ADJUST to array of timestamps that you want to use instead

    idxBase = [-30 -15]; % ADJUST to window of time (seconds) relative to each event that you want to use as each event's baseline window 

% Set plot color parameters

    comparisonOptions = {'1: green gradient' '2: blue gradient' '3: red gradient' '4: gray gradient' '5: paired multicolor' '6: 405/470 vs 435/490' '7: choose colors in photomplotColor'};
    comparisonType = 1; %ADJUST to number corresponding to comparisonOption you want the colors to be. Gradients are light to dark

    PlotIndividual = 0; %ADJUST if you want to see graphs for each ind animal
